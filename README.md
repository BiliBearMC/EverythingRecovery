MinecraftMod

Welcome to my GitHub, which was created on February 22, 2020, to share my story with minecraft and my experience in minecraft mod development.

As a player who has played minecraft for 8 years, I didn't really get to know this game until 2019. When I was in junior high school, I first came into contact with this game. 

At that time, I got the first iPhone in my life. In the meantime, the PE version of minecraft has been released. My classmates recommended this game to me and told me that it would be more interesting to play on PC. And then, we used Hamachi to open the minecraft server of version 1.2.5, and played for two years, Experienced 1.2.5, 1.3.2, 1.3.4, 1.4.2, 1.4.6, 1.5.2, 1.7.2, etc.

It can be said that I became a part of promoting minecraft's development in China when minecraft began to be popular. Now I still remember the picture when I first entered minecraft. My spawn was at a seaside, I stand on a square sand beside which tree has square leaves, square trunk. It's refreshing to me but simple. Just as I recommend this game to people around me.

Minecraft didn't have many mods at that time, not even many textures and lighting effects. It didn't have the thrill of many 3D games, and it didn't have the image quality of those games. It's even hard to play multiplayer games. 

I remember the house I first time made, to be exact, is a tower like building. It is carved out of a high mountain. Yes, it is dug from the top of a mountain layer by layer. Now I think I was stupid, but this is the charm of minecraft. You don't have to create. You can just transform it on the basis of the map.
